This is a simple REST API built using Node.js and Express.js.
It serves user data from a local JSON file and demonstrates common API endpoints such as:

Fetching all users

Fetching a random user

Fetching a user by ID

Perfect for learning the basics of API development and testing with tools like Postman or cURL.
