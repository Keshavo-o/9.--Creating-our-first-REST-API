## first run "npm install" in git-bash terminal to install required modules for this project

This is a simple REST API built using Node.js and Express.js.
It serves user data from a local JSON file and demonstrates common API endpoints such as:

Fetching all users

Fetching a random user

Fetching a user by ID

Deleting an existing user 

Adding new users

Updating existing user details

Perfect for learning the basics of API development and testing with tools like Postman or cURL.

### will add more features later and we can implement it with MONGO DB for real world applications
